START
Having got all the basic setup (see git log) --
Have a baselined copy of the two dirs directory structure - stored seperately & copy into targets.

- copy the pre-existing source code files (StockItem.cs, StockRepo.Tests.cs) into releveant dirs
- remove files Class1.cs ... etc. for dirs

- create the template solution file StockRepo.cs
	- namespace etc
	- implementation class
	- empty bar a NotImpl example. ... some instructions? <put this in data subdirectory cp it in>

$ dotnet add .../StockRepo.Tests.csproj .../StockRepo.csproj <change for exercise two>

$ dotnet sln add ./StockRepo.Tests/StockRepo.Tests.csproj

DONE.

NEXT MANUAL WORKING OF IT!

TODO LIST CSHARP TDD COURSE =>

BUGS:
-	Ex 2 - list of test functions is wrong - 1st is wrong.
-	check earlier slides for typos.
- 	Add Exercise 1 - explanation-bit...

WANT-TO-DO:
-	Add 'STRIP' command to 'tpp' (or Extract ...).

IMPORTANT:
- 	setup on exercises. .sln etc. removing unnecessary files. must be smooth... smooth...
- 	TAG FOR APPIES. NEW REL.
- 	More notes on Exercise 2 - Create Cart and Cart.Tests

* update README:

???- NICE-TO-HAVE:
* use an 'interface' in the example code ... ??? Dependency Inversion?
? [annotations Setup ... TestFixture] - or just note! ??? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
? Assert.Etc()

DONE:
* Add Source Code Extract - For Exercises - only what you need ...
* check below for additional .net cmd line stuff (dotnet add ...)

******************
Part 2 of the TDD CSharp Course.

*** NB: Pre-course Preparation. ***
- clone and checkout latest version of course (I update it on the fly continuously when I give it).
- watch the video (20 mins) - may assist as well!
- recap your exercise 1 work - what was easy, what was confusing ...
- Think of questions - any at all: 'why are we doing this?', 'why should we write the tests first?', etc... anything. 
  Especially the questions you're possibly 'embarassed' to ask - they're the ones everyone generally has but no one mentions!

DETAILS BELOW:

Please:
** checkout the updated course from github - clone repo:
   https://github.com/markcollinscope/csharp-unit.git

** then use Branch (actually a Tag): 23.09.11-19.17_GITREL_V1.0.1

  - releases of the course are tagged using the format above - see the README file on GitHub - 
  it always says what the latest 'release' version of the course.

  - to view the README file in a browser (please do this) - just go to URL:
  https://github.com/markcollinscope/csharp-unit
  
  - README - 'read me' files are just a convention used in many projects, in which README.md or README.txt 
  or similar contain introduction/installation instructions for people new to a project.

  - you should do one for the apprentice-project - which explains how someone techie should navigate 
  and use the repo.

** Checkout this video on YouTube:
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfP_v6qCdcs - Dave Farley of Continuous Delivery Channel.
   Don't ask me why everything has to have a Japanese name (Dojo) - but it seems popular! :).

** Be prepared to chat about your experiences and code from Exercise 1. 
   - this is just about being honest. There's no 'right' answer - just experiential and what you ended up doing.
   - can do this as a group or in pairs if you like - your call.
